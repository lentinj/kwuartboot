To build, type "make".

Let's say your JTAG/UART is on /dev/ttyUSB0, and you have a u-boot.kwb you
want to test.

1. Power off the Kirkwood SoC
2. Make sure any terminal emulator is disconnected
3. Run the program as follows

  $ ./kwuartboot /dev/ttyUSB0 uboot.kwb

4. Power on the Kirkwood SoC
5. Start the terminal emulator - u-boot should be running.
